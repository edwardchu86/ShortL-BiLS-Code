%======================================================================================================
1) For FullL-BiLS algorithm:
  - Run the file FullL-BiLS.m in the folder BiLS-Fulllists for testing example.
  - Run the file FullL_BiLS_Simulations.m in the folder BiLS-Fulllists for simulations in the paper
  
2) For SLS algorithm
  - Run the file SLS_Simulations.m in the folder BiLS-Fulllists for simulations in the paper
  
3) For ShortL-BFS algorithm:
  - Run the file ShortL_BFS.m in the folder BiLS-Shortlist for testing example.
  - Run the file ShortL_BFS_Simulations.m in the folder BiLS-Shortlist for simulations in the paper
  
4) For ShortL_BiLS algorithm
  - Run the file ShortL_BiLS.m in the folder BiLS-Shortlist for testing example.
  - Run the file ShortL_BiLS_Simulations.m in the folder BiLS-Shortlist for simulations in the paper
  
5) For Hill-Climbing algorithm
   - Run the file HillClimbing_Simulations.m in the folder BiLS-Shortlist for simulations in the paper

6) For the SML algorithm
   - Run the filr SMLTest.m in the folder SML-Gelain.

Note:
  - All the SM instances are in the folder: Inputs
  - After runing experiments, the outputs of the algorithms are in the folder Outputs\test1
  - All the figures in the papers are produced by the codes in the folder: Outputs\test1
  - The results of SML algorithm as in the foler Outputs\test50
